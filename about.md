Tyler is a member of [Chef](http://chef.io)’s Customer Engineering team - championing successful patterns and delightful experiences in automation to enterprise customers large and small.  Prior to working at Chef he spent a decade as an engineer for Adobe developing and automating commerce services for [adobe.com](http://www.adobe.com) using a variety of technologies.

Tyler once attended a week of ATG training because some Sr. Director spent a million dollars or more on ATG without really consulting the teams if it'd be useful to have.  That project didn't go live as was hoped.

Tyler lives in Vancouver, WA (not the one in Canada) and when he’s not programming enjoys lacrosse and using his passport (most frequently to go watch lacrosse games in or around that other Vancouver in Canada).
