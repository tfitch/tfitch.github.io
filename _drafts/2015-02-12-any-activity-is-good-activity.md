## TL;DR
I was in a rut the end of last year where I felt I wasn't doing much software engineering with my work.  Then I finally noticed my profile page on GitHub has a metric called the [Contribution calendar](https://help.github.com/articles/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile-page/#contributions-calendar).

## What counts as "GitHub activity"?

## Pleasant side effects
I focused on turning my customer's questions in to action items I could turn in to commits.
I moved this blog from Tumblr so that my writing would count as commits.  And in the process learned some at Jekyll.
Instead of just asking for a Pull Request to be merged to the Ohai repo, I asked how to do it, and then did it myself.
